	my $checks_pass = run_all_tests( $app );

	# If the checks passed, write a file for the prepare-commit-msg hook to know
	# that we've already run the checks and there's no need to do it a second time.
	# This is what allows it to detect when --no-verify was used.

	# Indicate if we should allow continuing to the commit message or not.
	return $checks_pass
		? $HOOK_EXIT_SUCCESS
		: $HOOK_EXIT_FAILURE;
}


=head2 run_all_tests()

Run all the tests available for the pre-commit hook and return whether issues
were detected.

	my $tests_success = run_all_tests( $app );

This is a two step operation:

=over 4

=item 1. We load all the plugins that support "pre-commit", and run them to
analyze the overall pre-commit operation.

=item 2. Each staged file is loaded and we run plugins that support
"pre-commit-file" on each one.
